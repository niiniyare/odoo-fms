## Section 1 — Quick Start

Get from unboxed hardware to receiving your first pump transaction in under 15 minutes. (Hardware bring-up is identical regardless of the ERP behind it — only the destination URL/payload handler differs.)

### 1.1 Prerequisites

- PTS-2 BOX-001 or SDK-001 powered on (12V DC, 2–5A adapter)
- microSD Class 10 formatted FAT32 inserted
- CR2032 battery installed (for RTC — without it timestamps are wrong)
- Your computer on the same LAN as the PTS-2

### 1.2 First Connection

**Default network settings:**

| Parameter | Default |
|---|---|
| IP address | 192.168.1.117 |
| HTTP port | 80 |
| HTTPS port | 443 |
| Login | admin |
| Password | admin |

Set your computer's Ethernet adapter to the same subnet (e.g. 192.168.1.10,
mask 255.255.255.0, gateway 192.168.1.13). Open a browser:

```
http://192.168.1.117    (DIP-1 switch ON)
https://192.168.1.117   (DIP-1 switch OFF — accept the self-signed cert)
```

Accept the login prompt with `admin` / `admin`.

> **Change the default password immediately** under Configuration → Users.

### 1.3 Minimum Configuration to Record a Transaction

1. **Configuration → Pumps tab** — set Pump Port 1 to protocol and baud rate
   matching your dispenser (or "37. Pump Simulator" for testing)
2. **Configuration → Grades tab** — add at least one fuel grade with a price
3. **Configuration → Nozzles tab** — link nozzle 1 of pump 1 to the fuel grade
4. **Configuration → Parameters → Device: Controller → SD Flash Disk Settings**
   — enable "Save pump transactions to SD"

With these four steps done, take the nozzle up on the pump simulator. The pump
moves to FILLING state. Put it down. Check Reporting → Pumps — you should see
one transaction row.

### 1.4 First Remote Upload (pointed at Odoo)

1. **Configuration → Settings → Remote Server Settings**
   - Domain name: `fms.shelldomain.co.ke` (your Odoo instance's public domain)
   - Server user: `admin`
   - Upload status: checked, URI `/fms/pts2/receive`, period 1 second
   - Server port: 443
   - Secret key: a strong random value matching `res.company.fms_pts2_secret_key` in Odoo
2. Verify DNS: NETWORK SETTINGS → DNS `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`
3. Verify gateway matches your router

Watch for the green connectivity indicator in the Remote Server Settings section.
Then check Odoo: `Settings → Technical → Logs` or `FMS → Configuration → PTS-2 Devices`
should show `last_seen` updating every second once connected. As a quick sanity
check before going live, you can first point the URIs at Technotrade's public
test server (`https://www.technotrade.ua/PTS2/Status?PtsId=<your_device_id>`) to
confirm network connectivity is correct, then switch the URI to your Odoo endpoint
and a strong production secret key.

## Section 2 — Hardware Reference

(Unchanged from the original guide — the PTS-2 hardware does not care which ERP receives its data.)

### 2.1 Controller Variants

| Model | MCU | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| PTS-2 | STM32F427 | Standard deployments up to 120 pumps |
| PTS-2 PRO | STM32H743 / STM32H753 | High-throughput sites, future headroom |

**Packaging options:**

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| PTS2-PCB-001 | Bare PCB board — embed inside your own enclosure |
| PTS2-BOX-001 | PCB in metal box with cable glands and power switch |
| PTS2-SDK-001 | BOX-001 + USB/RS-485 converter + USB/RS-232 converter + cabling |

For production station deployment: **PTS2-BOX-001**.
For development and testing: **PTS2-SDK-001** (includes simulators and API).

### 2.2 Electrical Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Power supply | 12 V DC |
| Current consumption | 700 mA max (SDK: 850 mA) |
| Operating temperature | −40 °C to +60 °C |
| Dimensions | 85 × 58 × 30 mm (PCB) |
| Weight | 200 g |
| RTC battery | CR2032 3V DC |
| Storage | microSD Class 10, FAT32 |

### 2.3 Port Map

| Port | Interface | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| ETHERNET | RJ-45 | jsonPTS — management systems, cloud server, web browser |
| PC PORT | RS-232 3-wire | UniPump binary protocol — legacy POS / PTS-1 compatibility |
| PUMP PORT 1–4 | RS-485 2-wire | Fuel dispenser control (4 independent protocols) |
| LOG PORT | RS-232 3-wire | ATG probe / console |
| USER PORT | RS-232 3-wire | ATG probe / console |
| DISP PORT | RS-485 or RS-232 | Price boards or ATG (interface selected via parameter) |
| DEBUG PORT | RS-232 2-wire (TxD+GND) | Firmware diagnostic output, 115200 baud 8N1 |
| EXT PORT | RS-232 3-wire | GPS module, optional expansion |

> **Wiring rule:** Never connect cable shields to any PTS-2 port. Connect the
> shield to ground on the dispenser side only. Use SFTP CAT 5E or CAT 6 for all
> RS-485 and current-loop runs. Minimum 0.3 m separation between power and
> signal cables in conduit.

### 2.4 DIP-Switch Reference

Applied at power-on only — changes during operation have no effect until restart.

| Switch | OFF (default) | ON |
|---|---|---|
| DIP-1 | HTTPS port 443 | HTTP port 80 |
| DIP-2 | Digest authentication | Basic authentication |
| DIP-3 | Normal startup | Format SD card on startup |
| DIP-4 | Normal startup | Reset all config to factory defaults |

**Special combination — DIP-3 + DIP-4 both ON:**
Resets to factory defaults then looks for `Config.js` in the SD card root and
restores from it automatically. User accounts are never included in the backup
for security reasons — reconfigure them manually.

### 2.5 Status LED

| Pattern | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Toggle every 1 second | Normal operation | None |
| Rapid blink every 100 ms | Boot error | Check SD card: present, correctly seated, FAT32 |
| No blink | No power or firmware crash | Check power supply; see Section 14.1 |

### 2.6 Capacity Limits

| Resource | Limit |
|---|---|
| Pumps | 120 |
| Probes / tanks | 20 |
| Fuel grades | 20 |
| Price boards | 5 (up to 10 displays each) |
| RFID readers | 120 |
| RFID tags | No limit |
| Users | 10 |
| Pump transaction records | 100,000 |
| Tank measurement records | 100,000 |

## Section 3 — Protocol Architecture

### 3.1 Two Inbound Protocol Interfaces

The PTS-2 exposes two distinct protocol surfaces depending on which port you
connect to:

**jsonPTS (Ethernet port)**
Technotrade's JSON-based proprietary protocol. HTTP or HTTPS. Used by the
built-in web server, all new management system integrations, and the remote
server communication channel. The full specification is a separate document
(*"jsonPTS communication protocol specification for PTS-2 controller"*) available
from Technotrade on request — see Appendix A for how to obtain it.

**UniPump (PC port / RS-232)**
Binary protocol. Kept for backward compatibility with systems already speaking
the PTS-1 protocol. Supports the same 120 pumps and 20 probes. If you are
building new software, use jsonPTS over Ethernet instead.

### 3.2 Three jsonPTS Communication Models

Every integration with the Odoo FMS uses one or more of these three models:

```
MODEL 1 — Web Server API (synchronous request/response)
  Your code → HTTP GET/POST → PTS-2 web server → JSON response

  Use for: pump control commands, config reads, report generation.
  Latency: 50–200 ms typical on LAN.

MODEL 2 — HTTP Push (async, PTS-2 as client)
  PTS-2 → HTTP POST (pump sale / tank reading / alert) → Your server
  Your server → HTTP 200 OK → PTS-2 marks record uploaded

  Use for: receiving all operational data in near real time.
  Guarantee: at-least-once delivery with SD card buffering.
  Deduplication required on your server.

MODEL 3 — WebSocket (bidirectional, persistent)
  PTS-2 → WebSocket connect (RFC 6455) → Your server
  PTS-2 ↔ Your server (full duplex, persistent)

  Use for: real-time pump status stream + sending commands back.
  Latency: sub-second.
  Reconnect: PTS-2 reconnects automatically on disconnect.
```

For the Odoo FMS integration, Model 2 is the backbone (every pump transaction,
tank measurement, delivery, and alert lands in Odoo this way), Model 1 is used
for outbound commands and diagnostics, and Model 3 is **optional** — only
required if you need sub-second pump-status streaming to a live dashboard,
since Odoo does not natively terminate third-party WebSocket clients (see §5
and `→ FMS §10.5` for the two supported patterns: direct HTTP commands, or a
small bridge service).

### 3.3 Protocol Transparency

Your integration code needs to know only the jsonPTS interface. The PTS-2
internally translates to every supported dispenser or ATG brand's native
protocol. Adding a new dispenser brand later requires only a PTS-2 firmware
update — no changes to your Odoo addon code.

```
Odoo FMS (jsonPTS only)
       │
       ▼
    PTS-2
       ├── Pump Port 1 → Gilbarco G-SITE RS-485
       ├── Pump Port 2 → Tatsuno current loop
       ├── Pump Port 3 → Wayne RS-485
       └── LOG Port    → Gilbarco Veeder Root TLS RS-232
```

### 3.4 Multi-Master Control

Multiple management systems can connect simultaneously through different ports.
The PTS-2 internally tracks which system holds an authorisation lock on each
dispenser at any moment. This enables the monitoring-only pattern (Section 12.4)
where a new cloud system and an existing POS coexist without conflict.

---

## Section 4 — HTTP Push Integration

### 4.1 How It Works

The PTS-2 acts as an HTTP client. For each enabled upload type it maintains two
counters on the SD card: total records saved and total records uploaded. On each
upload cycle it POSTs unuploaded records to the configured URI until it receives
HTTP 200. On non-200 or no response it retries indefinitely.

```
Records saved to SD card (PUMPTRN.CSV, TANKMSR.CSV, etc.)
         │
         │ HTTP POST, JSON body, X-Signature header
         ▼
Odoo HTTP controller — /fms/pts2/receive
         │
         │ HTTP 200 OK (anything else = retry)
         ▼
PTS-2 advances the upload counter
```

**Critical requirements on the Odoo side:**
1. Return HTTP 200 for every successfully received record — including duplicates.
   If you return non-200, the PTS-2 retries forever. Duplicates arrive after any
   outage; your deduplication logic (a `_sql_constraints` unique key on the
   staging model, `→ FMS §7.11`) handles them, your HTTP response does not.
2. Process the record (create the `fms.forecourt.transaction`, etc.) before
   returning 200 if you need guaranteed processing. Returning 200 then failing
   internally loses data — Odoo's controller should commit the transaction
   (the request's implicit `cr.commit()` at the end of a successful HTTP
   request) before sending the response.

### 4.2 Enabling Upload Types

Each type has two prerequisites — one on the controller, one on the probe (for
tank-related types). Both must be enabled or upload silently never happens.

| Upload type | Controller parameter | Additional requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Pump transactions | SD Flash Disk Settings → Save pump transactions to SD | — |
| Tank measurements | SD Flash Disk Settings → Save tank measurements to SD | — |
| In-tank deliveries | SD Flash Disk Settings → Save tank measurements to SD | Probe parameter → Automatic in-tank delivery detection |
| Alerts | SD Flash Disk Settings → Save alerts to SD | Tank alarms configured on Tanks tab |
| GPS records | SD Flash Disk Settings → Save GPS records to SD | GPS module installed + enabled |
| Status | No SD prerequisite | Sent on a configurable interval |
| Configuration | No SD prerequisite | Sent on every config change |

> **The most common integration failure:** pump transactions not uploading because
> "Save pump transactions to SD" was not enabled. Verify this during
> commissioning by confirming PUMPTRN.CSV exists and is growing on the SD card.

### 4.3 Remote Server Configuration

`Configuration → Settings → Remote Server Settings:`

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Server IPv4 address | Static IP of your Odoo server, or `0.0.0.0` if using domain name |
| Domain name | e.g. `fms.shelldomain.co.ke` — PTS-2 resolves DNS at connect time |
| Server user | Select a user from the Users tab (PTS-2 authenticates to your server as this user) |
| Timeout of server response | Seconds to wait before marking an upload attempt as failed |
| Secret key | HMAC-SHA256 shared secret — see Section 4.4 |

For each upload type: check the enable checkbox, set the URI path, set the port.

### 4.4 HMAC Signature Verification

Every HTTP upload includes an `X-Signature` header:

```
X-Signature: <hmac-sha256-hex-digest-of-raw-request-body>
```

Your Odoo controller verifies this to confirm the request came from your PTS-2
(not a man-in-the-middle) and that the body was not altered in transit.

```python
import hmac, hashlib

def verify_pts2_signature(body: bytes, received: str, secret: str) -> bool:
    """
    Always use hmac.compare_digest — constant-time comparison prevents
    timing attacks. Never use == for HMAC comparison.
    """
    expected = hmac.new(secret.encode("utf-8"), body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected, received)
```

The secret key is a shared string configured identically on the PTS-2 and on
the company record in Odoo (`res.company.fms_pts2_secret_key`, a custom field
added by the `fms` addon). Generate with:

```python
import secrets
secret = secrets.token_hex(32)   # 64 hex chars, 256 bits of entropy
```

Rotate the key by updating both sides within the same maintenance window. Any
requests with a mismatched signature should return HTTP 401. The PTS-2 will
retry — once you update the key on the PTS-2 side, uploads resume.

### 4.5 URI Routing

Each upload type has its own configurable URI. In Odoo, route all types to one
`http.Controller` route and dispatch by `RecordType` (the simplest approach,
matching `→ FMS §10.2`), or register separate `@http.route` methods per type:

```
All → /fms/pts2/receive       (dispatch by RecordType)

Or per type:
  Pump transactions → /fms/pts2/pump_transaction
  Tank measurements → /fms/pts2/tank_measurement
  Deliveries        → /fms/pts2/delivery
  Alerts            → /fms/pts2/alert
  Status            → /fms/pts2/status
```

### 4.6 Pump Transaction Payload

One POST per completed pump sale.

```json
{
  "RecordType":        "PumpTransaction",
  "DeviceId":          "003B00265030500420303531",
  "DateTime":          "2026-05-17 22:00:00",
  "DateTimeStart":     "2026-05-17 21:50:00",
  "Pump":              1,
  "Nozzle":            2,
  "GradeId":           1,
  "TransactionNumber": 12345,
  "UserId":            1,
  "Volume":            "0001000.000",
  "Amount":            "0214200.00",
  "Price":             "000214.200",
  "VolumeTotal":       "0000000000123456.700",
  "AmountTotal":       "0000000000567890.100",
  "TCVolume":          "0000985.000",
  "TagLength":         16,
  "Tag":    "000000000000000000000000000000001234567890abcdef"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `RecordType` | Always `"PumpTransaction"` |
| `DeviceId` | Hardware ID — use this to identify which station sent the record |
| `DateTime` | Transaction end time (controller's local clock) |
| `DateTimeStart` | Transaction start time |
| `Pump` | Pump number, 1-based |
| `Nozzle` | Nozzle number on the pump, 1-based |
| `GradeId` | Fuel grade ID as configured on Grades tab |
| `TransactionNumber` | Sequential non-resettable counter — deduplication key |
| `UserId` | ID of the user/system that authorised this pump |
| `Volume` | Litres dispensed this transaction |
| `Amount` | Currency value dispensed this transaction |
| `Price` | Price per litre at time of transaction |
| `VolumeTotal` | Cumulative non-resettable volume totalizer at transaction end |
| `AmountTotal` | Cumulative non-resettable amount totalizer at transaction end |
| `TCVolume` | Temperature-compensated volume (at 15 °C base condition) |
| `TagLength` | Meaningful character count in the Tag field |
| `Tag` | RFID tag identifier — 48-char zero-padded hex string |

**Deduplication key:** `TransactionNumber` + `DeviceId`. In Odoo, enforce this
as a `_sql_constraints` unique index on `fms.forecourt.transaction`:

```python
_sql_constraints = [
    ("pts_tx_dedup_uniq", "unique(pts_transaction_number, device_id)",
     "Duplicate PTS-2 transaction — already recorded."),
]
```

Catch the resulting `psycopg2.errors.UniqueViolation` in the controller and
return `{"status": "ok"}` regardless, exactly as required by §4.1.

**Totalizer anti-theft check:** `VolumeTotal` is non-resettable and increments
for every litre dispensed whether authorised or manual. If the difference between
consecutive `VolumeTotal` values is greater than the `Volume` of the transaction
between them, fuel was dispensed outside management system control.
`→ FMS §13.3` for how this is surfaced in the Meter Reading Discrepancy Log.

**Tag extraction:**
```python
def effective_tag(tag_raw: str, tag_length: int) -> str:
    return tag_raw[-tag_length:] if tag_length else tag_raw.lstrip("0")
```

### 4.7 Tank Measurement Payload

Posted each time the PTS-2 detects a product height change exceeding the
configured threshold.

```json
{
  "RecordType":       "TankMeasurement",
  "DeviceId":         "003B00265030500420303531",
  "DateTime":         "2026-05-17 20:00:00",
  "Tank":             1,
  "Status":           0,
  "Alarms":           "00",
  "PHPresent":        true,
  "ProductHeight":    "00002500.0",
  "WHPresent":        true,
  "WaterHeight":      "00000010.0",
  "TPresent":         true,
  "Temperature":      "+00000020.0",
  "PVPresent":        true,
  "ProductVolume":    "0000020000",
  "WVPresent":        true,
  "WaterVolume":      "0000000100",
  "UPresent":         true,
  "Ullage":           "0000005000",
  "PTCVPresent":      true,
  "ProductTCVolume":  "0000019891",
  "DPresent":         true,
  "Density":          "00000759.0",
  "MPresent":         true,
  "Mass":             "00015180.0",
  "FPPresent":        true,
  "FillingPercentage": 57
}
```

The `Present` boolean for each measurement type indicates whether the connected
probe model provides that parameter. When `false`, ignore the corresponding value
field. `Status` 0 = OK; non-zero = probe error code.

**Alarm bitmask (Alarms field, hex):**

| Bit | Alarm |
|---|---|
| 0 | Product critical high |
| 1 | Product high |
| 2 | Product low |
| 3 | Product critical low |
| 4 | Water high |
| 5 | Probe failure |
| 6 | Probe float stuck |
| 7 | Tank leakage |

`→ FMS §13` for how tank measurements feed the wetstock reconciliation engine.

### 4.8 In-Tank Delivery Payload

Posted when the PTS-2 automatically detects a fuel delivery (product level rising
faster than pump dispensing can account for).

```json
{
  "RecordType":             "FuelDelivery",
  "DeviceId":               "003B00265030500420303531",
  "DeliveryStart":          "2026-05-17 19:00:30",
  "DeliveryEnd":            "2026-05-17 19:50:00",
  "Tank":                   1,
  "ValuesPresent":          "0055",
  "ProductHeightStart":     "00000125.0",
  "ProductHeightEnd":       "00002500.0",
  "WaterHeightStart":       "00000010.0",
  "WaterHeightEnd":         "00000010.0",
  "TemperatureStart":       "+00000020.0",
  "TemperatureEnd":         "+00000020.0",
  "ProductVolumeStart":     "0000001000",
  "ProductVolumeEnd":       "0000020000",
  "ProductTCVolumeStart":   "0000000995",
  "ProductTCVolumeEnd":     "0000019891",
  "DensityStart":           "00000759.0",
  "DensityEnd":             "00000759.0",
  "MassStart":              "00000759.0",
  "MassEnd":                "00015180.0",
  "PumpsDispensedVolume":   "0000000000"
}
```

`PumpsDispensedVolume` is the volume dispensed through pumps during the delivery
window. Apply the concurrent-sales correction:

```
dip_measured = ProductVolumeEnd − ProductVolumeStart + PumpsDispensedVolume
variance     = docket_volume − dip_measured
```

`→ FMS §12.1` for the full delivery reconciliation workflow.

### 4.9 Alert Payload

```json
{
  "RecordType":   "Alert",
  "DeviceId":     "003B00265030500420303531",

`IsStarted: true` = condition started. `IsStarted: false` = condition cleared.
Store both events (as `fms.forecourt.alert` records) and compute duration for
alerting and SLA tracking.

**Key alert codes:**

| Code | Alert |
|---|---|
| 1 | Device offline |
| 2 | Device error |
| 3 | Product critical high |
| 4 | Product high |
| 5 | Product low |
| 6 | Product critical low |
| 7 | Water height high |
| 8 | Tank leakage detected |
| 9 | Probe float stuck |
| 10 | Power supply loss |
| 11 | Low battery voltage |
| 12 | High CPU temperature |

### 4.10 Status Payload

Sent on a configurable interval (typically every 1–60 seconds). Contains
real-time state of every connected device.

```json
{
  "RecordType": "Status",
  "DeviceId":   "003B00265030500420303531",
  "DateTime":   "2026-05-17 22:30:00",
  "Controller": {
    "battery_ok": true,
    "sd_card_ok": true,
    "gps_fix":    false
  },
  "Pumps": [
    {"number": 1, "state": "IDLE",    "online": true},
    {"number": 2, "state": "FILLING", "online": true, "volume": "012.450"},
    {"number": 3, "state": "OFFLINE", "online": false}
  ],
  "Probes": [
    {"number": 1, "online": true,  "product_height": "2500.0", "alarms": "00"},
    {"number": 2, "online": true,  "product_height": "1800.0", "alarms": "04"},
    {"number": 3, "online": false, "product_height": "0.0",    "alarms": "00"}
  ],
  "Boards":   [{"number": 1, "online": true}],
  "Readers":  [{"number": 1, "online": true}]
}
```

In Odoo, a high-frequency Status payload should **not** create a database
record per push (that would flood the table). Instead, the controller writes
only the latest snapshot onto `fms.pts2.device` (a few JSON/Char fields,
overwritten in place) and relays the frame live to any open HQ Dashboard
browser sessions via `self.env["bus.bus"]._sendone(...)`.
`→ FMS §28.2` for how status feeds the HQ Dashboard's open-shift and alert panels.

### 4.11 Configuration Upload Payload

Sent automatically whenever any configuration changes on the PTS-2. Contains the
equivalent of the `Config.js` backup file. Store it as an attachment
(`ir.attachment`) on the `fms.pts2.device` record per upload, giving you a
versioned configuration history directly in Odoo's Document/Attachment system
— enabling remote audit and disaster recovery without a bespoke versioning table.

---

## Section 5 — WebSocket Integration

### 5.1 Connection Model

The PTS-2 connects to your server as a WebSocket client (RFC 6455). You never
need a static IP or open inbound firewall at the station — outbound HTTPS on
port 443 is the only egress required.

```
Your bridge service (WebSocket listener)
         │
         │  wss://fms.yourdomain.com/pts2-bridge/ws
         │  ← PTS-2 initiates the connection
         │
         │  Real-time status frames (every ~1 second)  ──→
         │  ←── Commands (authorize, price, tags, etc.)
         │
         ▼
      PTS-2 Controller
```

The PTS-2 reconnects automatically after any disconnect using the configured
reconnection period. For Shell Maanzoni's deployment on a consumer router, expect
occasional reconnects — design your bridge handler as stateless (no session
state that breaks on reconnect).

> **Odoo-specific note:** Odoo itself is not the WebSocket *server* here.
> Odoo's `bus.bus` websocket exists to push events to Odoo's own logged-in
> browser sessions, not to accept inbound connections from arbitrary third-party
> hardware. If you need this real-time channel (Phase 3 in `→ FMS §19`), run a
> small standalone bridge process (`pts2_bridge/`, shown in `→ FMS §10.5`
> Pattern B) that terminates the PTS-2's WebSocket and relays into Odoo via
> `odoorpc`/XML-RPC. For Phases 1–2, skip this section entirely and use the
> HTTP push (§4) for inbound data and the Web Server API (§6) for outbound
> commands — sufficient for the full shift/reconciliation workflow.

### 5.2 Nginx Configuration (Required, for the Bridge Service)

If you do deploy the bridge from §10.5 Pattern B, its WebSocket endpoint needs
the same Nginx `Upgrade` header passthrough Odoo's own `/websocket` path needs
(`→ FMS §18`):

```nginx
location /pts2-bridge/ws {
    proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:8765;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header   Upgrade    $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header   Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header   Host       $host;
    proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
    proxy_send_timeout 3600s;
}
```

Without this, the Nginx proxy strips the `Upgrade` header and the WebSocket
handshake silently fails with a 101 that never upgrades.

### 5.3 Command Reference

All commands share a common envelope. Fields specific to each command follow.
These are issued either directly over the WebSocket (if using the bridge) or
translated 1:1 into the equivalent Web Server API HTTP call (§6) when using
the simpler HTTP-command pattern from `→ FMS §10.5` Pattern A.

**Envelope:**
```json
{
  "Command":  "<CommandName>",
  "DeviceId": "003B00265030500420303531"
}
```

---

**AuthorizePump — Unlock a pump for dispensing**

```json
{
  "Command":     "AuthorizePump",
  "DeviceId":    "003B00265030500420303531",
  "Pump":        2,
  "PresetType":  1,
  "PresetValue": "050.000"
}
```

| PresetType | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | No preset — fill until nozzle down |
| 1 | Volume preset — fill N litres |
| 2 | Amount preset — fill to N currency value |
| 3 | Full tank — attendant enters preset at pump keyboard |

---

**StopPump — Emergency stop**

```json
{
  "Command":  "StopPump",
  "DeviceId": "003B00265030500420303531",
  "Pump":     2
}
```

---

**SuspendPump / ResumePump — Pause and resume filling**

```json
{"Command": "SuspendPump", "DeviceId": "...", "Pump": 2}
{"Command": "ResumePump",  "DeviceId": "...", "Pump": 2}
```

---

**SetGradePrices — Update pump display prices**

```json
{
  "Command":  "SetGradePrices",
  "DeviceId": "003B00265030500420303531",
  "Grades": [
    {"Id": 1, "Price": "214.200"},
    {"Id": 2, "Price": "229.000"},
    {"Id": 3, "Price": "242.900"}
  ]
}
```

After this command the PTS-2 immediately pushes updated prices to all connected
price boards.

`→ FMS §26.2` for how the Bulk Price Update wizard triggers this command.

---

**UpdateTagList — Sync RFID tags**

```json
{
  "Command":  "UpdateTagList",
  "DeviceId": "003B00265030500420303531",
  "Tags": [
    {
      "Id":     "000000000000000000000000000000001234567890abcdef",
      "Name":   "Swedi Abuti",
      "Length": 16,
      "Valid":  true
    },
    {
      "Id":     "000000000000000000000000000000009876543210fedcba",
      "Name":   "Peter Mbeve",
      "Length": 16,
      "Valid":  true
    }
  ]
}
```

The tag list on the PTS-2 is replaced entirely. Send the complete active list on
every sync, not just changes.

`→ FMS §10.5` for the `sync_rfid_tags()` helper that builds this payload from
`hr.employee` records.

---

**GetStatus — Request immediate status snapshot**

```json
{
  "Command":  "GetStatus",
  "DeviceId": "003B00265030500420303531"
}
```

Response is the same format as the Status upload payload (Section 4.10).

---

**GetConfiguration / SetConfiguration — Remote config management**

```json
{"Command": "GetConfiguration", "DeviceId": "..."}
```

Returns the full controller configuration. Use `SetConfiguration` with the same
structure to apply changes remotely — equivalent to using the web server
Configuration page without browser access.

### 5.4 Pump State Values

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `IDLE` | Nozzle in holster, pump ready |
| `NOZZLE` | Nozzle lifted, waiting for authorisation |
| `FILLING` | Dispensing fuel |
| `OFFLINE` | No communication with pump |

The `NOZZLE` → `FILLING` transition requires an `AuthorizePump` command (or
automatic authorisation if enabled in pump parameters).

---

## Section 6 — Web Server API

All endpoints require HTTP authentication (Digest or Basic depending on DIP-2).
Base URL: `https://<pts2-ip>` or `http://<pts2-ip>` depending on DIP-1.

**This is the recommended outbound channel from Odoo** (`→ FMS §10.5` Pattern
A) — Odoo's `fms.pts2.commands` abstract model calls these endpoints directly
with `requests`, with no persistent connection to maintain.

### 6.1 Device Information

```
GET /
```

Returns firmware version, device ID, battery status, SD card state, GPS state,
and the list of communication protocols included in this firmware build.

Key fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `device_id` | 24-character hex — use as the `DeviceId` in all remote server records, and as the lookup key for `fms.pts2.device` |
| `firmware_version` | e.g. `"R11"` — check against latest before deployment |
| `battery_voltage` | Alert and replace CR2032 if below 3.0 V |
| `sd_card_free_mb` | Alert if < 50 MB |

### 6.2 Configuration Read and Write

```
GET  /config               Read all configuration
GET  /config/<tab>         Read one tab
POST /config/<tab>         Write one tab (JSON body)
```

Available tabs: `settings`, `pumps`, `probes`, `params`, `grades`, `tanks`,
`nozzles`, `boards`, `readers`, `wireless`, `users`.

### 6.3 Pump Control

```
GET  /pumps                Current state of all pumps
POST /pumps/<pump_number>  Send action to a specific pump
```

Actions available via the web API mirror the WebSocket commands (Section 5.3):
`authorize`, `stop`, `suspend`, `resume`, `get_totals`, `set_price`, `get_price`,
`get_tag`, `set_lights`.

For production Odoo deployments, the Web Server API is the *primary* pump
control channel (not a fallback) — see `→ FMS §10.5` Pattern A. Only reach for
the WebSocket bridge (§5) if sub-second status streaming is a hard requirement.

### 6.4 Tank Monitoring

```
GET /tanks                 Current measurements for all tanks
```

Returns all probe measurement fields per tank — same structure as the
TankMeasurement upload payload (Section 4.7) plus last delivery information.

### 6.5 Report Generation

```
GET /reports/<type>
  ?pump=<N>
  &tank=<N>
  &grade=<N>
  &user=<name>
  &tag=<hex>
  &from=<ISO datetime>
  &to=<ISO datetime>
  &format=json|csv|excel
```

Report types: `pumps`, `tanks`, `deliveries`, `reconciliation`, `gps`, `alerts`.

The reconciliation report compares pump-dispensed volume against tank ATG
measurements for the same period — a built-in cross-check before the more
detailed wetstock reconciliation that runs at shift close in Odoo.
`→ FMS §13` for the FMS-side wetstock engine.

### 6.6 Fuel Grade Prices

```
POST /config/grades
```

```json
{
  "grades": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Unleaded",  "price": "214.200", "tc_coefficient": "0.00110"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "V-Power",   "price": "229.000", "tc_coefficient": "0.00110"},
    {"id": 3, "name": "Diesel",    "price": "242.900", "tc_coefficient": "0.00084"}
  ]
}
```

Price update immediately propagates to all connected price boards. Pumps receive
it on the next authorisation, or immediately if the pump protocol supports live
price push. In Odoo, this call is fired by `fms.pts2.commands.push_price_update()`
whenever a `product.pricelist.item` changes with `fms_effective_shift = "current"`
(`→ FMS §24.1, §26.2`).

### 6.7 RFID Tag List

```
GET  /config/tags          Read all tags
POST /config/tags          Replace entire tag list
```

Tag list body format mirrors the `UpdateTagList` WebSocket command (Section 5.3).
The list is also stored in `TAGS.CSV` on the SD card — downloadable and
uploadable from Configuration → Readers tab.

### 6.8 Configuration Backup and Restore

```
GET  /config/backup        Download Config.js
POST /config/restore       Upload Config.js (multipart)
```

Store `Config.js` as an `ir.attachment` on the corresponding `fms.pts2.device`
record in Odoo (or in your own backup system) and re-upload after firmware
updates or factory resets. **User accounts are not included in the backup** —
maintain a separate secure record of user credentials.

### 6.9 Firmware Update

```
POST /firmware             Upload c_pts2.bin or c_pts2p.bin (multipart)
```

Controller restarts automatically after upload and applies the firmware. Takes
under one minute. See Section 15 for the complete firmware update procedure
including pre-update backup steps.

---

## Section 7 — SD Card Data Files

(Unchanged from the original guide — file formats are device-side and ERP-agnostic.)

### 7.1 File Index

| File | Description | Header row |
|---|---|---|
| `PUMPTRN.CSV` | Pump transaction records | Yes |
| `TANKMSR.CSV` | Tank measurement records | Yes |
| `TANKDLV.CSV` | In-tank delivery records | Yes |
| `GPSRECS.CSV` | GPS tracking records | Yes |
| `ALERTS.CSV` | Alert event records | Yes |
| `TAGS.CSV` | RFID tag list | **No** |
| `NNCALIB.CSV` | Tank calibration chart (NN = zero-padded tank number) | **No** |
| `ACALIBNN.CSV` | Auto-generated calibration chart | **No** |
| `CONFIG.JS` | Configuration backup | n/a |
| `SETTINGS.INI` | Internal settings | n/a |
| `PTSLOG.TXT` | System log | n/a |
| `PORTLOG.BIN` | Communication log (encrypted) | n/a |
| `SERVER.LOG` | Remote server upload log | n/a |
| `C_PTS2.BIN` | Firmware update (auto-applied on startup, then deleted) | n/a |

### 7.2 CSV Date Format

All timestamps use the format `DD.MM.YY HH:MM:SS` — note the two-digit year.
When parsing, interpret YY < 70 as 20YY and YY >= 70 as 19YY (standard Unix
convention). Store in Odoo's `Datetime` fields as full ISO 8601, UTC-normalised
(Odoo always stores `Datetime` fields in UTC internally and converts for display
per-user timezone — make sure the PTS-2's RTC and the conversion you apply
agree on which timezone the raw string represents, typically EAT/UTC+3 for
Kenyan deployments).

```python
from datetime import datetime

def parse_pts2_datetime(s: str) -> datetime:
    return datetime.strptime(s, "%d.%m.%y %H:%M:%S")
```

### 7.3 PUMPTRN.CSV Schema

```
DateTime, Pump, Nozzle, Transaction, UserId, Volume, Amount, Price,
VolumeTotal, AmountTotal, DateTimeStart, TCVolume, TagLengthSymbols, Tag
```

| Column | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DateTime | DD.MM.YY HH:MM:SS | Transaction end |
| Pump | 2-digit int | |
| Nozzle | 1-digit int | |
| Transaction | 5-digit int | Dedup key with DeviceId |
| UserId | 2-digit int | Authorising user |
| Volume | NNNNNNNN.NNN | Litres |
| Amount | NNNNNNNNNN.NN | Currency |
| Price | NNNNNNNN.NNN | Per litre |
| VolumeTotal | NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN.NNN | Non-resettable totalizer |
| AmountTotal | NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN.NN | Non-resettable totalizer |
| DateTimeStart | DD.MM.YY HH:MM:SS | Transaction start |
| TCVolume | NNNNNNNN.NNN | Temperature-compensated litres |
| TagLengthSymbols | 2-digit int | Meaningful chars in Tag |
| Tag | 48-char hex | Zero-padded RFID identifier |

### 7.4 TANKMSR.CSV Schema

```
DateTime, Probe, Status, Alarms,
PHPresent, ProductHeight, WHPresent, WaterHeight,
TPresent, Temperature, PVPresent, ProductVolume,
WVPresent, WaterVolume, UPresent, Ullage,
PTCVPresent, ProductTCVolume, DPresent, Density,
MPresent, Mass, FPPresent, FillingPercentage
```

Heights in mm (one decimal). Volumes as 10-digit integers (litres, no decimal).
Temperature as signed value with leading sign character `+00000020.0`.

### 7.5 TANKDLV.CSV Schema

```
DateTimeStart, DateTimeEnd, Tank, ValuesPresent,
ProductHeightStart, ProductHeightEnd, WaterHeightStart, WaterHeightEnd,
TemperatureStart, TemperatureEnd, ProductVolumeStart, ProductVolumeEnd,
ProductTCVolumeStart, ProductTCVolumeEnd, DensityStart, DensityEnd,
MassStart, MassEnd, PumpsDispensedVolume
```

`ValuesPresent` is a 4-char hex bitmask indicating which parameter columns are
populated. `PumpsDispensedVolume` is essential for delivery variance calculation
— see Section 4.8.

### 7.6 TAGS.CSV Schema

No header row. Four comma-separated fields per line:

```
TagId (48-char hex), TagLength (2-digit int), Validity (0/1), Name (≤20 chars)
```

```
000000000000000000000000000000001234567890abcdef,16,1,Swedi Abuti
000000000000000000000000000000009876543210fedcba,16,1,Peter Mbeve
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012345,05,0,Deactivated Tag
```

### 7.7 NNCALIB.CSV Schema

No header row. Two 9-digit fields per line:

```
LevelIn_0_1mm (9-digit int), VolumeInUnits (9-digit int)
```

**Critical:** The level column is in **0.1 mm units**, not mm. To convert a
strapping table from mm to the calibration file format, multiply each height
value by 10.

```python
def mm_to_calib_units(mm: float) -> int:
    return round(mm * 10)

def format_calib_row(height_mm: float, volume_l: float) -> str:
    return f"{mm_to_calib_units(height_mm):09d},{round(volume_l):09d}"
```

File naming: `01CALIB.CSV` for tank 1, `02CALIB.CSV` for tank 2, etc.
Auto-generated charts are named `ACALIB01.CSV`, `ACALIB02.CSV`, etc. These map
1:1 onto the `line_ids` of the corresponding `fms.tank.calibration.chart` record
in Odoo (`→ FMS §7.7`); an import script can read the CSV directly into the
`one2many` rows.

### 7.8 ALERTS.CSV Schema

```
DateTime, DeviceType, DeviceNumber, IsStarted, Code
```

`DeviceType`: 0=Controller, 1=Pump, 2=Probe/Tank, 3=Price Board, 4=Reader.
`IsStarted`: 1=alert began, 0=alert cleared.

### 7.9 GPSRECS.CSV Schema

```
DateTime, Latitude, NorthSouthIndicator, Longitude, EastWestIndicator,
SpeedOverGround, CourseOverGround, Mode
```

Latitude in DDMM.MMMM format; Longitude in DDDMM.MMMM format.
Mode: `A` = active GPS fix, `V` = void (no fix).

## Section 8 — WFC Wireless Communicator

(Unchanged from the original guide — purely hardware/networking, independent of ERP choice.)

### 8.1 What It Is

The WFC (Wireless Forecourt Communicator) is a small companion board that
eliminates all RS-485 and current-loop cable runs between the PTS-2 and the
forecourt equipment. Each WFC unit installs inside a dispenser, connects to the
dispenser's internal communication interface, and talks to the central PTS-2
controller over a secured Wi-Fi network.

```
PTS-2 (in server room / kiosk)
         │
         │  Wi-Fi (secured)
         ├──────────────────── WFC unit inside Pump 1
         ├──────────────────── WFC unit inside Pump 2
         ├──────────────────── WFC unit inside Pump 3
         ├──────────────────── WFC unit inside Pump 4
         ├──────────────────── WFC unit inside Pump 5
         ├──────────────────── WFC unit inside Pump 6
         ├──────────────────── WFC unit inside Pump 7
         └──────────────────── WFC unit inside Pump 8
```

No signal cables between the controller room and the forecourt islands at all.
The PTS-2 still uses its standard configuration — the WFC layer is transparent
to the jsonPTS protocol.

### 8.2 WFC Hardware Interfaces

Each WFC board provides a rich set of physical interfaces so it can connect to
any dispenser brand:

- Various current loop interfaces (2-wire, 3-wire, 4-wire)
- Voltage-driven interfaces
- RS-485
- RS-422
- RS-232
- Additional port for RFID readers installed on nozzles

This means the WFC supports all 156 dispenser brands that the PTS-2 supports.
The WFC handles the cable connection to the dispenser; the PTS-2 handles the
protocol.

### 8.3 PTS-2 Configuration for WFC

1. Go to **Configuration → Wireless tab**
2. Select which PTS-2 pump ports are using wireless communication
3. For each device on those ports, assign the WFC unit's IP address and port

The PTS-2 sends pump control packets over Wi-Fi to each WFC unit's IP address
instead of over the RS-485 cable. From the jsonPTS protocol perspective,
nothing changes — pumps are still addressed by number.

### 8.4 Network Requirements for WFC

- A Wi-Fi access point covering the entire forecourt area with good signal at
  each pump island
- Each WFC unit gets a static IP address (or DHCP reservation by MAC address)
  on the same network as the PTS-2
- The access point should be dedicated to forecourt automation — do not share
  it with customer Wi-Fi
- Router placement: ideally in the controller room or kiosk; ensure signal
  reaches the furthest island at acceptable strength

### 8.5 Wired vs Wireless Decision Matrix

| Factor | Wired (RS-485) | Wireless (WFC) |
|---|---|---|
| Cabling labour | High — trenching or conduit per island | None |
| Ongoing reliability | Excellent once installed | Good — depends on Wi-Fi quality |
| Interference risk | Low (shielded cable) | Possible (forecourt RF environment) |
| Cost per pump | Cable + conduit + labour | WFC unit hardware cost |
| Maintenance | Rare — cables rarely fail | Wi-Fi AP maintenance; WFC firmware updates |
| Pump placement changes | Requires re-cabling | Change IP assignment only |
| Suitable for retrofits | Harder in existing buildings | Easier |

### 8.6 Shell Maanzoni Recommendation

Shell Maanzoni has 8 pumps across 4 islands. The wired option requires running
shielded cable from the controller location to each of the 4 islands, with each
island potentially needing conduit through the forecourt apron.

WFC eliminates all of that at the cost of 8 WFC units (one per pump). Before
committing to either approach:

1. Request WFC pricing from Tamara (Appendix A) — the email quotes PTS-2 unit
   prices but not WFC unit prices
2. Get a cable run estimate from your electrician for comparison
3. Survey Wi-Fi signal coverage at each island before committing to WFC

The WFC is particularly attractive for Shell Maanzoni if the pump islands are
at a significant distance from the controller location or if underground conduit
is expensive.

`→ FMS §18` for server infrastructure considerations that are independent of the
wired vs wireless choice.

## Section 9 — SDK and Development Environment

### 9.1 What the SDK Contains

The PTS2-SDK-001 (order code) is the recommended starting point for any
integration development. It contains everything needed to build and test the
full integration in an office environment without a live petrol station.

**Hardware (identical to the production BOX-001 plus converters):**
- PTS-2 controller in metal box
- USB/RS-485 interface converter (for pump simulator)
- USB/RS-232 interface converter (for probe simulator)
- Cabling

**Software:**
- `SimUniPump.exe` — Windows fuel dispenser simulator (up to 99 pumps)
- `SimUniProbe.exe` — Windows ATG probe simulator (up to 20 probes)
- jsonPTS communication protocol specification document
- PTS2-WEB server component
- API reference implementations in: JavaScript, C#, C++, Java

### 9.2 Development Environment Setup

```
Developer PC
├── Ethernet cable → PTS-2 Ethernet port (jsonPTS)
├── USB/RS-485 converter → PTS-2 PUMP PORT 1 (runs SimUniPump.exe)
└── USB/RS-232 converter → PTS-2 USER PORT (runs SimUniProbe.exe)
```

Power on the PTS-2 (12V DC). Set your computer's Ethernet adapter to the same
subnet as the controller (192.168.1.x). The pump and probe simulators each
appear as a COM port via the USB converters (FTDI chip drivers from
`ftdichip.com/drivers/vcp-drivers/`).

**One-time configuration (do this before writing any integration code):**

```
1. Configuration → Pumps tab
   Pump Port 1: Protocol "2. UniPump", Baud "9600"
   Assign pumps 1–4, physical addresses 1–4

2. Configuration → Probes tab
   Probe port USER: Protocol "9. UniProbe", Baud "9600"
   Assign probes 1–3, physical addresses 1–3

3. Configuration → Parameters → Device: Pump
   For each pump 1–4: Parameter 1.2 "Protocol type" = "UniPump for PTS"

4. Configuration → Grades tab
   Add fuel grades matching your station (UX, VP, DX)

5. Configuration → Nozzles tab
   Link each nozzle to its grade and tank

6. Configuration → Parameters → Device: Controller
   SD Flash Disk Settings → enable all Save checkboxes

7. Run SimUniPump.exe
   Settings: 9600 baud, 8N1 → Open the RS-485 COM port
   Verify green+red LEDs blink on PTS-2 Pump Port 1

8. Run SimUniProbe.exe
   Settings: 9600 baud, 8N1 → Open the RS-232 COM port
   Verify green+red LEDs blink on PTS-2 USER port
```

Only green LED blinking (no red) means the PTS-2 is sending but not receiving —
check wiring or configuration.

### 9.3 Language Guide

**Which language to use depends on where the code runs:**

| Language | Best for | SDK support |
|---|---|---|
| Python | Odoo controllers/cron jobs, server-side receiver, CLI tools, the optional PTS bridge | Derive from jsonPTS spec (not in SDK but straightforward) |
| JavaScript | Browser-side pump monitoring widget (OWL component in the Odoo backend), Node.js bridge | Included in SDK |
| C# (.NET Core) | Windows POS systems, cross-platform server | Included in SDK (open source) |
| C++ | Embedded systems, performance-critical gateways | Included in SDK |
| Java | Android mobile apps, cross-platform server | Included in SDK |

For the Odoo FMS integration, Python is the primary language.
`→ FMS §10` for the complete Python HTTP controller and outbound-command implementations.

### 9.4 JavaScript Integration

The SDK ships a JS reference implementation. For browser-based monitoring (pump
status display inside an Odoo OWL dashboard widget, `→ FMS §28.3`), connect
either directly to the PTS-2 on the LAN, or — more realistically for a
production cloud-hosted Odoo — to the PTS bridge's relay channel rather than
the PTS-2 directly:

```javascript
// WebSocket connection to PTS-2 controller (direct LAN connection — dev/test only)
class PTS2Monitor {
  constructor(pts2Host, credentials) {
    this.host = pts2Host;
    this.auth = btoa(`${credentials.user}:${credentials.password}`);
    this.ws   = null;
    this.onStatus = null;   // callback: (statusPayload) => void
  }

  connect() {
    this.ws = new WebSocket(`ws://${this.host}/api/pts2/ws`);

    this.ws.onopen = () => {
      this.ws.send(JSON.stringify({
        Command:  "Authenticate",
        User:     atob(this.auth).split(":")[0],
        Password: atob(this.auth).split(":")[1]
      }));
      this.ws.send(JSON.stringify({Command: "GetStatus"}));
    };

    this.ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
      if (msg.RecordType === "Status" && this.onStatus) {
        this.onStatus(msg);
      }
    };

    this.ws.onclose = () => {
      setTimeout(() => this.connect(), 5000);
    };
  }

  authorize(pumpNumber, presetType = 0, presetValue = null) {
    const cmd = {Command: "AuthorizePump", Pump: pumpNumber, PresetType: presetType};
    if (presetValue) cmd.PresetValue = presetValue;
    this.ws.send(JSON.stringify(cmd));
  }

  updatePrices(grades) {
    this.ws.send(JSON.stringify({
      Command: "SetGradePrices",
      Grades:  grades.map(g => ({Id: g.id, Price: g.price}))
    }));
  }
}
```

For the production OWL dashboard widget inside Odoo's backend, subscribe to
the `bus.bus` channel the PTS bridge (or the HTTP controller's status handler)
publishes to, using Odoo's standard `useBus`/`busService` hooks instead of
opening a raw WebSocket from the browser — this keeps the browser talking only
to Odoo, never directly to forecourt hardware:

```javascript
/** @odoo-module **/
import { useBus, useService } from "@web/core/utils/hooks";

setup() {
    const busService = useService("bus_service");
    useBus(busService, "notification", (payload) => {
        // payload contains the relayed PTS-2 status frame
    });
    busService.addChannel("fms_pump_status");
}
```

### 9.5 C# Integration

The SDK ships a .NET Core open-source API compatible with Windows, Linux, and
macOS. If a Windows-based POS or a standalone bridge service is preferred over
Python for a particular site, the same controller pattern shown for Odoo's
Python controller in `→ FMS §10.2` applies, swapped for ASP.NET Core:

```csharp
// Minimal HTTP push receiver in ASP.NET Core (relays into Odoo via XML-RPC)
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Text;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/pts2")]
public class PTS2ReceiverController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly string _secret;
    private readonly IOdooRelayService _relay;

    public PTS2ReceiverController(IConfiguration config, IOdooRelayService relay)
    {
        _secret = config["PTS2:SecretKey"];
        _relay  = relay;
    }

    [HttpPost("receive")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Receive()
    {
        using var reader = new StreamReader(Request.Body);
        var body = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();

        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(_secret))
        {
            var received = Request.Headers["X-Signature"].FirstOrDefault() ?? "";
            var expected = ComputeHmac(body, _secret);
            if (!CryptographicOperations.FixedTimeEquals(
                    Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(expected), Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(received)))
                return Unauthorized();
        }

        var data = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Deserialize<
            Dictionary<string, object>>(body);

        // Relay to Odoo via XML-RPC, mirroring the same dispatch as the
        // native Python controller in → FMS §10.2
        await _relay.CreateForecourtTransactionAsync(data);

        return Ok();  // Must return 200 for PTS-2 to advance upload counter
    }

    private static string ComputeHmac(string body, string secret)
    {
        using var hmac = new HMACSHA256(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(secret));
        var hash = hmac.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(body));
        return Convert.ToHexString(hash).ToLower();
    }
}
```

> In practice, for an Odoo-centric deployment, prefer the native Python
> `http.Controller` (§4.5, `→ FMS §10.2`) over a separate C# relay service —
> it removes an entire moving part (no XML-RPC hop, no second process to
> deploy/monitor). The C# path above is documented for sites where a
> Windows-based gateway is already mandated by other on-site systems.

### 9.6 Python Integration

Python is not in the SDK but is the primary language for Odoo. The complete
production-ready Python receiver and outbound-command helpers are in the FMS
Implementation Guide.
`→ FMS §10.2` for `fms/controllers/pts2.py` (HTTP receiver).
`→ FMS §10.5` for `fms/models/fms_pts2_commands.py` (outbound HTTP commands)
and the optional WebSocket bridge.

For standalone Python (outside Odoo, e.g. quick bench testing before wiring up
the real controller):

```python
import json, hmac, hashlib
from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler

SECRET = "your-secret-key-here"

class PTS2Handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_POST(self):
        length = int(self.headers.get("Content-Length", 0))
        body   = self.rfile.read(length)
        sig    = self.headers.get("X-Signature", "")

        expected = hmac.new(SECRET.encode(), body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
        if not hmac.compare_digest(expected, sig):
            self.send_response(401)
            self.end_headers()
            return

        data = json.loads(body)
        handle(data)

        self.send_response(200)
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(b'{"status":"ok"}')

    def log_message(self, *args):
        pass

def handle(data):
    rt = data.get("RecordType")
    if rt == "PumpTransaction":
        print(f"Sale: Pump {data['Pump']} Nozzle {data['Nozzle']} "
              f"Vol {data['Volume']} L Amt {data['Amount']}")
    elif rt == "TankMeasurement":
        print(f"Tank {data['Tank']} Level: {data.get('ProductHeight')} mm")
    elif rt == "Alert":
        print(f"Alert: Device {data['DeviceType']}/{data['DeviceNumber']} "
              f"Code {data['Code']} Started={data['IsStarted']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server = HTTPServer(("0.0.0.0", 8080), PTS2Handler)
    print("Listening on :8080")
    server.serve_forever()
```

### 9.7 PTS2-WEB Server Component

The SDK includes a component called **PTS2-WEB server**. This is a separate
piece of software (not the built-in PTS-2 web server on the controller itself)
intended for developers building web-based management front-ends.

PTS2-WEB server acts as a bridge:

```
Browser / Web App
      │
      │  REST / WebSocket (jsonPTS)
      ▼
PTS2-WEB Server (runs on your PC or server)
      │
      │  jsonPTS (Ethernet)
      ▼
PTS-2 Controller
      │
      ▼
Dispensers / Probes
```

It handles the jsonPTS communication with the controller and exposes a clean
API to your web front-end, abstracting the lower-level protocol details. Could
be used as an alternative to writing the optional PTS bridge from `→ FMS §10.5`
Pattern B from scratch — useful for a quick proof-of-concept browser-based pump
dashboard before deciding whether to invest in a full bridge service.

To obtain full documentation and the PTS2-WEB server binaries: contact Tamara
at `ts@technotrade.ua` or WhatsApp `+380958347530` (see Appendix A).

---

## Section 10 — Device Configuration Reference

(Unchanged from the original guide — device-side, ERP-agnostic.)

### 10.1 Parameters System

All PTS-2 configuration is stored as typed parameters in 4-byte (32-bit) memory
sections. Parameters are grouped by device type. The full catalogue is in the
configuration files `pts_config_en.js` (English), accessible at:

```
https://192.168.1.117/pts_config_en.js
```

This file lists every supported protocol, baud rate, and parameter with its
type, range, mask, shift, and default value.

### 10.2 Essential Controller Parameters

**SD Flash Disk Settings** — these must be enabled for any data to upload:

| Parameter | Must enable for |
|---|---|
| Save pump transactions to SD | Pump transaction upload, reports |
| Save tank measurements to SD | Tank measurement upload, delivery detection |
| Save GPS records to SD | GPS tracking (requires GPS module) |
| Save alerts to SD | Alert upload |

**Port Flexible Communication Settings** — per probe port (LOG, USER, DISP):
- Data bits (7 or 8)
- Stop bits (1 or 2)
- Parity (None, Even, Odd)

Some ATG brands require specific settings here. Check the ATG manufacturer's
documentation for the correct communication parameters.

**Decimal Digits System Settings:**
Number of decimal digits in volume, amount, and price. **Must match the
dispenser display configuration** — mismatch causes all volume and amount values
to be off by a power of 10.

**Logging Settings:**
Enable "Extended logging for data upload to remote server" to generate
`SERVER.LOG`. Turn on only when troubleshooting connectivity — it generates
significant log volume.

### 10.3 Pump Parameters

**PUMP AUTHORIZATION SETTINGS:**

| Parameter | When to enable |
|---|---|
| Automatically authorize pump on nozzle up | Standalone operation without POS |
| Automatically close transaction | Automatic mode — close on nozzle down |
| Read pump totals automatically | Always enable — needed for totalizer-based theft detection |

**TAG VERIFICATION SETTINGS:**

| Parameter | Effect |
|---|---|
| Verify tag in list before authorization | Pump only authorizes if the presented RFID tag is in the allowed list |
| Keep verifying tag during filling | Pause filling if tag is removed mid-fill (AVI anti-theft) |

**PUMP MULTIPLIERS:**
Adjust volume, price, and amount scale factors. Use if the dispenser display
shows values in unexpected units or the number of decimal places differs from
the PTS-2 settings.

### 10.4 Probe Parameters

| Parameter | Effect |
|---|---|
| Probe offset from tank bottom | Distance from sensor base to tank floor in mm. Critical for accurate volume calculation. |
| Automatic volume from calibration chart | Enable if probe measures level only (not volume). Requires calibration chart uploaded. |
| Automatic TC volume | Calculate temperature-compensated volume at 15 °C. Requires temperature measurement and grade TC coefficient. |
| Automatic in-tank delivery detection | Enable for delivery auto-detection and `TANKDLV.CSV` recording. |
| Automatic tank leakage detection | Raise alert if tank loses product faster than pumps can account for. |
| Automatic alarm check | Monitor high/low product and water levels. |

### 10.5 Fuel Grade Configuration

For each grade: name, price per litre/gallon, temperature-expansion coefficient.

**Temperature-expansion coefficients at 15 °C:**

| Product | Coefficient |
|---|---|
| Petrol (PMS, UX, VP) | 0.00110 |
| Diesel (AGO, DX) | 0.00084 |
| Aviation Jet A-1 | 0.00094 |
| Kerosene (DPK) | 0.00094 |
| LPG propane | 0.00290 |
| LPG butane | 0.00200 |

For Shell Maanzoni: UX and VP both use 0.00110; DX uses 0.00084.
`→ FMS §6.3` for how fuel grades map to Odoo `product.product` records.

---

## Section 11 — Connected Devices

(Unchanged from the original guide — hardware compatibility, ERP-agnostic.)

### 11.1 Fuel Dispensers

**Connection interfaces supported:**

| Interface | Notes |
|---|---|
| RS-485 (2-wire A/B) | Most modern dispensers — direct connection |
| 2-wire current loop | Older Gilbarco, Tokheim — needs RS-485 converter |
| 3-wire current loop | Some Tokheim models |
| 4-wire current loop | Some Nuovo Pignone models |

Interface converter catalogue: `technotrade.ua/dispensers-interface-converters.html`

**Configuration steps:**
1. Configuration → Pumps tab: assign protocol and baud rate per pump port
2. Assign each pump to a port with its physical address (the ID set inside the
   dispenser)
3. Verify decimal digit settings match dispenser display (Parameters → Controller
   → DECIMAL DIGITS SYSTEM SETTINGS)
4. Set pump parameters per pump (Parameters → Pump)
5. Configure grades and nozzle linkages

**Operations available on all brands:**
get status, authorize, stop, suspend/resume, get/set price, get totals,
get filling info, get transaction info, TC volume calculation, set lights (brand
dependent), get tag (brand dependent).

**Built-in pump simulator:** Protocol "37. Pump Simulator" for development
without real hardware. Supports immediate dispensing, nozzle up/down simulation,
zero-volume transactions, and tag simulation.

### 11.2 ATG Systems and Probes

Up to 20 probes across 3 ports (LOG, USER, DISP). Each port independently
configurable for protocol, baud rate, data bits, stop bits, and parity.

**Configuration steps:**
1. Configuration → Probes tab: assign protocol and baud rate per probe port
2. Assign each probe to a port with its physical address
3. Configuration → Tanks tab: configure tanks (tank 1 = probe 1, tank 2 = probe 2)
4. Upload calibration charts per tank
5. Set probe parameters per probe

**Features available on all brands:**
product level, water level, temperature, product volume, water volume, ullage,
TC volume, density, mass (availability depends on probe model — check Present
flags in the measurement payload).

**Auto-calibration:** If no strapping table is available, enable automatic
calibration on the tank. The PTS-2 accumulates level and dispensing data over
several days of normal operation and generates `ACALIBNN.CSV` automatically.

**Built-in probe simulator:** Protocol "7. Probe Simulator". Supports all
measurement parameters and delivery event simulation.

### 11.3 Price Boards

Up to 5 boards, up to 10 price displays each. Connect via DISP port (RS-485
or RS-232, selectable via parameter).

Configuration on Boards tab: assign port, protocol, baud rate, physical address,
and which fuel grades each board should display.

Price boards update automatically whenever grade prices change in the PTS-2
— whether via web API, WebSocket command, or remote server configuration push.

### 11.4 RFID Readers and AVI Systems

Up to 120 readers. Configurable per port for protocol, baud rate, and
communication settings. Each reader is assigned to a specific pump (or all
pumps if Pump = 0).

**RFID for attendant authorisation:**
- Attendant taps RFID card → PTS-2 checks tag against allowed list → authorizes
  pump if valid
- All transactions saved with the attending tag ID — full per-attendant sales
  reporting

**AVI for vehicle identification:**
- Nozzle reader detects vehicle transponder when nozzle inserted in tank
- PTS-2 continuously re-reads during filling — if nozzle removed (canister theft),
  filling pauses automatically
- Filling resumes only when the original vehicle tag is detected again

`→ FMS §14` for how RFID tags map to `hr.employee` records and `fms.fleet.card` records.

---

## Section 12 — Integration Patterns

Each pattern is self-contained. A real deployment may combine elements of
multiple patterns at different phases.

### 12.1 Pattern A — Full Cloud (Recommended for New Installations)

**Topology:**
```
PTS-2 (station) → HTTPS push → Odoo FMS (cloud)
                 ← HTTP commands (Web Server API) ←
```

**PTS-2 configuration:**
- DIP-1 OFF (HTTPS)
- Remote server: domain name = your Odoo instance's domain, port 443
- All upload types enabled
- SD card logging enabled for all types
- No WebSocket configuration needed unless Phase 3 real-time streaming (§12.5) is in scope

**Data flow:**
- Pump transactions → Odoo creates `fms.forecourt.transaction` → linked to open Shift
- Tank measurements → Odoo's `fms.pts2.device` snapshot updates; stock levels read from `stock.quant`
- Deliveries → Odoo raises/updates a `purchase.order`/`stock.picking` for review
- Alerts → Odoo creates `fms.forecourt.alert`, triggers notifications via `mail`/`bus.bus`
- Outbound commands (price, authorise, RFID) → Odoo calls the PTS-2 Web Server API directly (§6)

`→ FMS §10` for all Odoo-side implementation.
`→ FMS §28` for the HQ Dashboard that consumes this data.

### 12.2 Pattern B — LAN Integration (Existing POS On-Site)

**Topology:**
```
Existing POS (LAN) ←→ PTS-2 (LAN) ←→ Dispensers
```

**Use case:** You have a site-level POS system that will drive the PTS-2
directly on the local network. Odoo upload is secondary or disabled.

**PTS-2 configuration:**
- DIP-1 ON or OFF depending on your POS's SSL capability
- No remote server needed (or optional for reporting only — point a second,
  read-only upload type at the Odoo controller for HQ visibility while the
  site POS retains pump control)
- POS connects to `http://192.168.1.117` or configured LAN IP

**Odoo's role:** Odoo may still receive uploads for HQ reporting while the POS
handles real-time station control.

### 12.3 Pattern C — Protocol Converter (Existing POS, Different Dispensers)

**Use case:** Your POS speaks one dispenser protocol (e.g. Gilbarco G-SITE) but
you have installed a different dispenser brand.

```
Existing POS (speaks Gilbarco) → PTS-2 Pump Port 2 (Gilbarco input)
                                → PTS-2 Pump Port 1 (Censtar output → actual dispensers)
```

No changes to the existing POS software. The PTS-2 translates internally.
Supports up to 4 simultaneous protocol conversions across its 4 pump ports.
Odoo plays no role in this pattern beyond optional reporting (as in Pattern B).

### 12.4 Pattern D — Monitoring Only (Existing Automated Station)

**Use case:** A station already has a POS system controlling dispensers. You
want cloud reporting and alerts in Odoo without disrupting the existing operation.

Install the PTS-2 in-line between the existing POS/controllers and the
dispensers. The PTS-2 passes all communication through while capturing every
transaction, tank reading, and alert and uploading to Odoo.

Existing POS: no changes required. The PTS-2 operates invisibly.

### 12.5 Pattern E — Phased Automation (Shell Maanzoni)

Shell Maanzoni's planned trajectory, mapped onto Odoo:

**Phase 1 — Data Collection (now):**
Deploy PTS-2 in automatic mode. All pump sales auto-recorded and uploaded to
Odoo via `/fms/pts2/receive`. Meter readings, dip readings, and cash
reconciliation entered manually by station staff in the Odoo backend.
`→ FMS §10.4` (cron watchdog) for PTS-2 monitoring.
`→ FMS §9` for manual station workflows that run in parallel.

**Phase 2 — Partial Integration:**
Odoo sends `AuthorizePump` HTTP commands (§6.3) before each fill. `pos.order`
records auto-created from `fms.forecourt.transaction` at shift close. Manual
meter entry simplified to verification rather than data entry.
`→ FMS §11.3` for shift close workflow.

**Phase 3 — Full Integration:**
RFID attendant cards synced from `hr.employee` records (§9.6/§10.5). Fleet
card authorisation via RFID readers linked to `res.partner` records. Price
push from Odoo to PTS-2 triggered automatically on EPRA gazette updates via
the Bulk Price Update wizard. Shift open/close fully automated, with the
optional WebSocket bridge (§5, `→ FMS §10.5` Pattern B) deployed if sub-second
pump-status streaming to the HQ Dashboard becomes a requirement.
`→ FMS §14, §26.2` for fleet card and bulk price push workflows.

## Section 13 — Security Reference

### 13.1 Transport Security

| Scenario | Protocol | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| Initial setup / LAN development | HTTP (DIP-1 ON) | Acceptable for private LAN only |
| Production LAN | HTTPS (DIP-1 OFF, self-signed cert) | Accept the cert in your client |
| Production remote upload to Odoo | HTTPS port 443 | Odoo's reverse proxy (Nginx) must have a CA-signed cert |
| Optional WebSocket bridge, LAN | WS | Acceptable for private LAN only |
| Optional WebSocket bridge, remote | WSS (TLS) | Required for internet-facing deployment |

### 13.2 Authentication Modes

**Digest (DIP-2 OFF, default):** Challenge-response. Credentials are never sent
in plain text. Preferred for all deployments.

**Basic (DIP-2 ON):** Credentials Base64-encoded in the Authorization header.
Only use over HTTPS where the header is encrypted by the TLS layer.

### 13.3 User Permission Model

Create a dedicated user on the PTS-2 for each system that talks to it. The
admin account should only be used for configuration via browser — never in
automated integrations.

| Permission | What it allows |
|---|---|
| Configuration | Read and write all configuration tabs |
| Control | Authorize pumps, stop pumps, set prices |
| Monitoring | Read pump states and tank measurements |
| Reports view | Generate and download reports |

Minimal permission sets:
- Odoo's inbound webhook (PTS-2's "server user" credential, §4.3): not a
  PTS-2-side permission at all — it identifies the PTS-2 to Odoo, not the
  other way around
- Odoo's outbound command user (the `api_user`/`api_password` on `fms.pts2.device`,
  used for §6 calls): Control + Monitoring
- Audit user: Reports view only

### 13.4 HMAC Key Management

```python
# Generate a strong secret key
import secrets
key = secrets.token_hex(32)   # 256-bit key, 64 hex characters
print(key)

# Store on res.company.fms_pts2_secret_key in Odoo — never in source code,
# and never as a plaintext Odoo system parameter visible to ordinary users.
```

**Key rotation procedure:**
1. Generate new key
2. Update `res.company.fms_pts2_secret_key` in Odoo
3. Update the PTS-2: Configuration → Settings → Remote Server Settings → Secret key
4. Both sides must be updated in the same maintenance window
5. Any device that is offline during rotation will resume uploading once
   reconnected and its key is updated

---

## Section 14 — Diagnostics and Troubleshooting

### 14.1 Status LED Diagnostic

| LED pattern | Likely cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Toggle 1s | Normal | None |
| Rapid blink 100ms | SD card issue | Check insertion; verify FAT32; use DIP-3 ON to reformat |
| No LED at all | No power | Check 12V supply, polarity, current rating |
| Normal LED but no web access | Network issue | Verify IP settings; try DIP-4 reset if password lost |

### 14.2 Self-Diagnostics Page

Tests all hardware peripherals. Before running diagnostics, connect the
board in loopback configuration:

- RS-485 ports (all 4 pump ports + DISP RS-485): interconnect all A lines
  together, all B lines together
- RS-232 ports (PC, LOG, USER, DISP RS-232): short TxD to RxD on each port

Results: green = OK, red = Error. A red pump port usually indicates a wiring
issue or a faulty RS-485 line driver.

### 14.3 Communication Logging

The Logging page records raw bytes on any selected port to `PORTLOG.BIN` (encrypted).
Use this to diagnose dispenser communication problems.

**Procedure:**
1. Note current time (shown on Logging page)
2. Select the port (e.g. Pump Port 1)
3. Set a stop time
4. Click START
5. Reproduce the problem
6. Click STOP and download the log file
7. Email to `support@technotrade.ua` with: device protocol, physical address,
   exact timestamp of the problem, detailed description

The file is encrypted — Technotrade must decode it.

### 14.4 Remote Server Upload Troubleshooting

**Step 1:** Enable extended logging.
Configuration → Parameters → Device: Controller → LOGGING SETTINGS →
"Extended logging for data upload to remote server" → Set.

**Step 2:** Download `SERVER.LOG` from Device Information page.

**Step 3:** Inspect each upload session for the failure mode, and cross-check
against Odoo's own logs (`Settings → Technical → Logging`, or the `fms.pts2.device`
record's `last_seen`/error fields).

Common failures and resolutions:

| Symptom in SERVER.LOG | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| DNS resolution failed | DNS server not configured | Network Settings → DNS: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 |
| Connection refused | Wrong port or Odoo not listening / Nginx misconfigured | Verify Nginx is proxying `/fms/pts2/receive` to the Odoo worker; check firewall rules |
| Connection timeout | Gateway misconfigured | Network Settings → Gateway must match router |
| 401 Unauthorized | Wrong HMAC secret | Verify the secret on the PTS-2 matches `res.company.fms_pts2_secret_key` exactly |
| 500 / non-200 response | Server-side error in the Odoo controller | Check Odoo's `odoo-server.log` for the traceback |
| Records stuck (counter not advancing) | SD logging disabled | Enable Save to SD in controller parameters |
| Duplicate records arriving | Odoo controller returning non-200 on the dedup path | The controller must catch the unique-constraint violation and still return 200 |

**Quick connectivity test:** Point upload to Technotrade's test server
(see Section 1.4). If the green indicator appears, your PTS-2 network and
configuration are correct — the problem is specific to your Odoo endpoint or
the reverse proxy in front of it.

### 14.5 Debug Port

Connect a serial terminal to the DEBUG port (2 wires: TxD + GND):
- Baud rate: 115200
- Data bits: 8
- Stop bits: 1
- Parity: None

Displays raw firmware boot messages and diagnostic output. Useful when the
web server is not reachable after a firmware update.

## Section 15 — Firmware Management

### 15.1 Update via Web Interface

Request the latest firmware from Technotrade (`support@technotrade.ua`) or
download from `technotrade.ua/pts2-forecourt-controller.html`.

**Before updating — always do these three things:**
1. Download `Config.js` (Configuration → Settings → BACKUP/RESTORE CONFIGURATION)
   and store it as an `ir.attachment` on the corresponding `fms.pts2.device`
   record in Odoo
2. Download all CSV report files (Reporting → Report files tab)
3. Note all user accounts and passwords — they are not backed up

**Update procedure:**
1. Firmware Update page → Select `c_pts2.bin` (PTS-2) or `c_pts2p.bin` (PTS-2 PRO)
2. Upload — controller restarts automatically
3. Update takes under 1 minute
4. Verify new firmware version on Device Information page
5. If configuration was lost, restore from `Config.js`
6. Reconfigure user accounts manually

### 15.2 Update via SD Card

1. Place `c_pts2.bin` / `c_pts2p.bin` in the SD card root
2. Power on — firmware auto-applies on startup
3. File is deleted after successful application

Use this method when web access is unavailable.

### 15.3 Recovery After Failed Update

If web access fails after a firmware update:

1. Set DIP-3 ON and DIP-4 ON
2. If you have `Config.js`: place it in the SD card root
3. Press the Restart button on the board
4. Controller resets to factory defaults, then auto-restores from `Config.js`
5. Return DIP-3 and DIP-4 to OFF
6. Reconfigure user accounts

## Appendix A — Procurement and Pre-Deployment

### A.1 Pricing (USD, March 2026)

| Product | Order Code | 1–2 pcs | 3–9 pcs (−5%) | 10–49 pcs (−10%) | 50–99 pcs (−15%) | 100+ pcs (−20%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PCB board (bare) | PTS2-PCB-001 | $950 | $903 | $855 | $807 | $760 |
| Controller in box | PTS2-BOX-001 | $1,025 | $974 | $923 | $871 | $820 |
| SDK (development kit) | PTS2-SDK-001 | $1,250 | $1,187 | $1,125 | $1,063 | $1,000 |

For a typical single-site deployment (Shell Maanzoni):
- 1 × SDK-001 for development: $1,250
- 1 × BOX-001 for the station: $1,025
- Total hardware: $2,275

For multi-site (3–9 sites) bulk order, the 3–9 unit pricing applies to
BOX-001: $974 per site, saving $51 per unit.

> WFC unit pricing not listed in the March 2026 quote — request separately
> from Tamara before committing to wired installation.

### A.2 BOM Per Site

In addition to the PTS-2 unit, each site requires:

| Item | Specification | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Power supply adapter | 12V DC, 2–5A | Standard industrial PSU; use UPS for continuous power |
| Network cable | FTP CAT 5E or FTP CAT 6 | Wired deployments only; one run per pump island |
| RTC battery | CR2032 3V DC | Pre-install before deployment; replace when voltage < 3.0V |
| Internet router | No specific requirements | Middle-range consumer router suitable |
| WFC units | 1 unit per pump | Wireless deployments only — price TBD |

### A.3 What to Request from Technotrade Before Development Begins

The following items are not publicly available and must be requested directly:

1. **jsonPTS communication protocol specification document** — the complete
   field-by-field protocol reference. Without this, the SDK API samples and this
   guide are sufficient to build a working integration, but the spec document
   fills in edge cases, error codes, and advanced commands.

2. **SDK-001 unit** — order to ship to Nairobi. Lead time: Kyiv, Ukraine →
   Nairobi varies; confirm with Tamara at time of order.

3. **WFC pricing and stock** — quote for 8 units (one per pump at Shell Maanzoni).

4. **BOX-001 quote** for Shell Maanzoni production deployment.
